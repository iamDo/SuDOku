* SuDOku
A small weekend project in which I attempt to make a Sudoku game using [[https://love2d.org/][LÃ–VE2D]]

** Libraries
[[https://github.com/rxi/classic][Classic]]: A small class module for Lua

[[https://github.com/kikito/inspect.lua][Inspect]]: A library to print tables in a human readable format
